# Creating Unit Tests  
Creating unit tests for Gradebot is actually pretty easy for the most part. Gradebot
expects all tests to self register themselves with the unit\_test handler. Gradebot
then imports all modules from a specific test folder, calls the run method on
each test object and receives the result object from the unit test.

The unit test should consist of a class which must contain a run method which 
takes a submission object as its parameter and returns a testResult object. The
testResult object will contain information such as if the test passed, how many
points should be awarded for the test, and any autogenerated comments. The module
then needs to import the register\_test function from the unit\_test module found
in the root of the tests folder. It should then call register\_test at the end 
of the file to register itself with gradebot. 

Once your test is written you must also add your class to the \_\_init\_\_.py file
found in the root of the assignment test directory. All modules imported in the 
\_\_init\_\_.py file will be loaded by Gradebot and have their register\_test
function called. If your module is not imported in the \_\_init\_\_.py file
Gradebot will not load and execute the test.

For examples of all of this see the template folder which has an example \_\_init\_\_.py
file as well as a template unit test.
